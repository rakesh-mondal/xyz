- Status badges and action menus for DNS operations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```
app/networking/dns/
├── page.tsx                     # Hosted zones listing
├── [id]/manage/page.tsx         # DNS records management  
├── create/page.tsx              # Zone creation flow
└── components/                  # DNS-specific components
```

### Key Features
- **Routing Protocols**: Simple, Weighted, GeoIP, HealthPort, HealthURL
- **Record Types**: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, SRV, NS with validation
- **TTL Management**: Flexible TTL settings (5 seconds to 86400 seconds)
